# Models

# This folder contains .mat files containing models of the 2DoF Drone dynamics.

#1DoF: these models represent the attitude dynamics (M to q) of the drone in 1DOF mode.

ANTX_2DOF_DRONE_pitch_model_1dof_doublet.mat	% continuous-time model obtained with doublet experiment data + free response data. see the doc of the identification lecture
